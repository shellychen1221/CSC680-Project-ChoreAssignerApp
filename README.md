## Introduction:
The Chore Assigner app aims to simplify the process of assigning and tracking household chores among roommates or family members, while also allowing users to track shared expenses and communicate important messages. This app will enable users to easily assign tasks, track completion, record shared expenses, and communicate through a message board, fostering a more organized and cooperative living environment.

## Features:

### Must Have:
1. **Task Management:**
   - Allow users to create different household chores such as cleaning, dishwashing, grocery shopping, etc.
   - Each task should include a title, description, frequency (daily, weekly, etc.), and reward points.

2. **Task Assignment:**
   - Users can browse and select available household chores.
   - Users can assign tasks to specific roommates or family members.

3. **User Management:**

   - Allow users to record shared expenses for household items, bills, etc.
   - Users can specify the amount, category, and contributors for each expense.
   - Provide a summary of total shared expenses and individual contributions.
   - Users can view detailed expense history and contributions.

### Nice to Have:
1. **Notice Board:**
   - Include a notice board feature where users can post important notices, reminders, or announcements.
   - Users can view and interact with notices posted by other users.
   - Admin users can moderate the notice board and remove inappropriate content.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Provide statistics and charts showing the distribution of completed household chores, earned points, and shared expenses among users.
   - Allow users to analyze their spending habits, contributions, and participation over time.

3. **Point System:**
   - Assign points to each completed household chore for the responsible person.
   - Users can view their own and other roommates' point rankings.
   - Implement daily points settlement to reset points accumulation and encourage consistent participation.
